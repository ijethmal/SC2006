Our application, called GatherHub, aims to bring community residents together by facilitating the formation of community groups for them to partake in shared interests together. 

It also serves as a comprehensive, growing list of sports facilities in Singapore categorized by type and residential area, sorted such that users can search through them to find one that suits their needs at the moment.
